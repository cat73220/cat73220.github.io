<p>Nemesys(close in 2018) is developing software company by 2D/3D computer graphics.</p>

<p>They started to sell their own painting software on workstations, Neozoic at the first. They also helped to develop a custom 3D modeling by semi-meta objects software with Polygon pictures. They released their application by their knowledge of computer graphics to the many computer software sceanes.</p>

<h2 id="computer-creators">Computer Creators</h2>

<p>1988 - 1992</p>

<p><a href="http://www.c-creators.co.jp">Computer Creators</a> were started from 2 young people as nowadayâ€™s start-up. It was placed on Suginami Tokyo so many years. Now, it is existed in Nagoya by 1 person.</p>

<p>This company mainly takes research and development as a job. They got consultant from customers and realized their idea into actual.</p>

<p>The intresting project was a ISDN modem for Macintosh, named TimeLiner which was developed by this single company as their own project. And, then sold it to public as actual commercial product.</p>

<p>They made many peripherals for several platforms. ex. Laser printe I/F for SUN3/4 for ASCII Corp. as hardware R&amp;D, software R&amp;D were a window syste for DTP on SPARDStation, a JPEG compression software using DSP for Mitsubishi corp., a renderer from 3D geometric data using OpenGL, a camera apps, TrigonScope and SFX Camera of iPhone Apps,</p>

<h2 id="tritech">Tritech</h2>

<p>1985 - 1988</p>

<p>This company was founded by 3 people and moved several place such Shibuya, Setagaya and Machida for getting bigger number of employee. And, it then closed around 1990s.</p>

<p>They were inventing a rom emulater, named ROMulater for reducing time of debugging their firmware instead of using EPROM avoiding using a UV eraser which was had a battery backed up Static-RAM, programmed by EPROM burner, used as a typical EPROM on circuits and sold in Akihabara and mail-order. When releasing into public in soon after, it was succeeded, but soon later, people copied and order was got reduced.</p>

<p>So, ROMulater was just one of their project. The company mainly did ODM. For example, developping high acculate computerized timer for a TV station, Developping semi-automatic remote controling a road roller, Developping and manufacturing multi frequency generater for LEADER K.K. as industrial mesurement equipment manufacturer, e.t.c.</p>

<p>As well as ODM companies, a project starts from researching, designing, making BOM, mass production, testing, releaseing and maintaining. This company did them as one-stop for the customers.</p>

<p>Based on the above, I larned the most of knowledges about developping and manufacturing computer devices along their senior engineers.</p>
