1985 - 1988

This company was founded by 3 people and moved several place such Shibuya, Setagaya and Machida for getting bigger number of employee. And, it then closed around 1990s.

They were inventing a rom emulater, named ROMulater for reducing time of debugging their firmware instead of using EPROM avoiding using a UV eraser which was had a battery backed up Static-RAM, programmed by EPROM burner, used as a typical EPROM on circuits and sold in Akihabara and mail-order. When releasing into public in soon after, it was succeeded, but soon later, people copied and order was got reduced.

So, ROMulater was just one of their project. The company mainly did ODM. For example, developping high acculate computerized timer for a TV station, Developping semi-automatic remote controling a road roller, Developping and manufacturing multi frequency generater for LEADER K.K. as industrial mesurement equipment manufacturer, e.t.c.

As well as ODM companies, a project starts from researching, designing, making BOM, mass production, testing, releaseing and maintaining. This company did them as one-stop for the customers.

Based on the above, I larned the most of knowledges about developping and manufacturing computer devices along their senior engineers.
