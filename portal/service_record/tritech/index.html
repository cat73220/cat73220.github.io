<p>1985 - 1988</p>

<p>This company was founded by 3 people and moved several place such Shibuya, Setagaya and Machida for getting bigger number of employee. And, it then closed around 1990s.</p>

<p>They were inventing a rom emulater, named ROMulater for reducing time of debugging their firmware instead of using EPROM avoiding using a UV eraser which was had a battery backed up Static-RAM, programmed by EPROM burner, used as a typical EPROM on circuits and sold in Akihabara and mail-order. When releasing into public in soon after, it was succeeded, but soon later, people copied and order was got reduced.</p>

<p>So, ROMulater was just one of their project. The company mainly did ODM. For example, developping high acculate computerized timer for a TV station, Developping semi-automatic remote controling a road roller, Developping and manufacturing multi frequency generater for LEADER K.K. as industrial mesurement equipment manufacturer, e.t.c.</p>

<p>As well as ODM companies, a project starts from researching, designing, making BOM, mass production, testing, releaseing and maintaining. This company did them as one-stop for the customers.</p>

<p>Based on the above, I larned the most of knowledges about developping and manufacturing computer devices along their senior engineers.</p>
