<h4 id="android-porting">Android Porting</h4>
<p><img src="/images/android_porting.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ported Android 2.2 on to FMSL(Fujitsu Micro Semiconductor Limited) internal development board for evaluating their ARM Cortex-A9(Dual Core) SoC.</p>

<p>The touchscreen(Resistive) was choosed by me and baught it from Aitendo, Akihaba. And, write the device driver from scratch fit into Android input middle ware. It was painfully slow becasue it uses UART for the I/F.</p>

<p>The ARM CA9 is Dual Core but Android uses the single core. The other core is used uiTron as a camera driver. Those OSes communicate with the custome IPC which I designed. This is also painfully make Android slow. Android has to use least two cores.</p>

<p>The IPC uses two methods which were memory mapping for the camera frame data and issuing command and reciving the response by the mail box IP the SoC already had.</p>

<p>This project was done at aLab inc Japan as full time contractee.</p>

<p><strong>feature</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>800MHz CPU Clock, 512K DDRAM, 256MB FlashROM</li>
  <li>Android input middle ware</li>
  <li>custome IPC between uiTron and linux</li>
  <li>Linux v3.0</li>

<p>This was made as the promotional item for selling much more their vevarages by their vending machine and used it as their company internal demonstration.</p>

<p>The idea was when consumer baught drinks by App(iPhone and Android) on vending machines they will get points and the points got limit to be able to have some thing, the vending machine electronicaly send it to this</p>

<p>This is a mp3 player so the prise of reaching the limit of points was a music into the consumers App.</p>

<p>This communicated by BLE for transmitting mp3 with App and by RFID for buying drink and getting points with vending machine.</p>

<p>This project was done at aLab inc Japan as full time contractee.</p>

<p><strong>feature</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>ARM Cortex-M3 SoC(Fujitsu FM3:MB89BF618T)</li>

<p>Just intrested in it because I have few Android smart phone they alread ROM updated by CyanongeMod and these H/W looks like to have this capability.</p>

<p>The one of hardware was the old HTC03A which had no lack to work this after my research and try because of the USB I/F.</p>

<p>The other one of hardware was HTC Aria S31HT which works well as I expected and succeeded.</p>

<p><strong>feature</strong></p>

<h4 id="papipo">PaPiPo</h4>
<p><img src="/images/papipo.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Cellular-phone promoted and sold by Bandai Company as a toy phone and used public PHS network and functioned as actual phone.</p>

<p>Used OOVM as OS made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Bak_%28computer_programmer%29">Lars Bak</a>, Denmark. Smalltalk language was used for system language on OOVM.</p>

<p>I believe this was the first and only device in the world used OOVM in public</p>

<p>This is the one of my favorite product ever I was involved developing mainly.</p>

<p>I developed the most of periperal device drivers on OOVM, graphics, setting UI/UX logics and booting OOVM as OS.</p>

<p>The hardware was designed and coding the ARM native device drivers with Cs company Japan.</p>

<p>The apps such as menu system, games were written in smalltalk</p>

<p>This project was done at eFlow inc Japan as employee.</p>

<p><strong>feature</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>ARM7TDMI</li>
  <li>ARM SDT(old C Compiler, ARM Assmbler and linker set)</li>
